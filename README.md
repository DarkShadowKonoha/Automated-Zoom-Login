# Automated-Zoom-Login

Zoom Login using Selenium, you just have to enter meeting link and Name(username) to login into meet automatically.

You can link this file with any task scheduler to join meetings/class at certain time.



Will be updating readme in few days.
For now I've added markdown and comments in the JupyterNotebook to help you understand the code easily.
